# FileManagerApplication

This application is written in Java and serves the following functions:

```
- Code to display the welcome screen. It should display:
  - Application name and the developer details.
  - The details of the user interface such as options displaying the user interaction information.
  - Features to accept the user input to select one of the options listed.
- The first option should return the current file names in ascending order. The root directory can be either empty or contain few files or folders in it.
- The second option should return the details of the user interface such as options displaying the following:
  - Add a file to the existing directory list.
      - You can ignore the case sensitivity of the file names.
  - Delete a user specified file from the existing directory list.
     - You can add the case sensitivity on the file name in order to ensure that the right file is deleted from the directory list.
     - Return a message if FNF (File not found).
 - Search a user specified file from the main directory.
    - You can add the case sensitivity on the file name to retrieve the correct file.
    - Display the result upon successful operation.
    - Display the result upon unsuccessful operation.
 - Option to navigate back to the main context
- There should be a third option to close the application.
- Implement the appropriate concepts such as exceptions, collections, and sorting techniques for source code optimization and increased performance.
